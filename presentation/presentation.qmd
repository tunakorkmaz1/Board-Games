## Context

Board Game Industry Overview

- Significant growth in recent years

- User ratings critical for game success

- **Research Question:** What attributes contribute to game ratings?

Key Focus

- Analyzing board game characteristics

- Understanding rating determinants

- Insights for game designers and publishers

## Dataset

- 21,925 board games sourced from BoardGameGeek as recent as 2021

- Key attributes including ratings, complexity, player count, themes, mechanics, etc.

```{r}
glimpse(games)
```

## Univariate EDA

```{r, layout="[[1,1]]"}
#| fig.show: "hold"
#| out.width: "50%"
ggplot(games, aes(x = AvgRating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Average Board Game Ratings", 
       x = "Average Rating", 
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

games <- games |> 
  filter(MfgPlaytime > 0) %>%
  mutate(LogPlaytime = log(MfgPlaytime))

ggplot(games, aes(x = LogPlaytime)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Log-Transformed Manufacturer Given Playtime", 
       x = "Log of Minutes of Playtime", 
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Approximately normal distribution

- Peak around 7.0-7.5 rating

- Suggests most games are rated positively

- Few extremely low or extremely high-rated games
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Right-skewed distribution transformed to fit better

- Helps normalize range of game playtimes

- Most games cluster around middle playtime ranges

- Allows for more meaningful analysis

## Bivariate EDA

```{r, layout="[[1,1]]"}
#| fig.show: "hold"
#| out.width: "50%"
ggplot(games, aes(x = log(MfgPlaytime), y = AvgRating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Playtime (Log Scale) vs. Average Rating",
       x = "Log Playtime",
       y = "Average Rating") +
  theme_minimal()

games |>
  filter(GameWeight != 0) |>
ggplot(aes(x = GameWeight, y = AvgRating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Game Complexity vs. Average Rating",
       x = "User Rated Game Complexity (Scale 1-5)",
       y = "Average Rating") +
  theme_minimal()
```

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Slight positive correlation

- Longer playtimes tend to have marginally higher ratings

- Significant variation in ratings across different playtimes

- Suggests playtime is a weak but potentially meaningful predictor
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Clear positive correlation

- More complex games tend to receive higher ratings

- Steeper trend line compared to playtime

- Complexity might be a stronger predictor of game ratings

## Initial Modeling

```{r, layout="[[1,1]]"}
#| fig.show: "hold"
#| out.width: "50%"
# Full model (all applicable variables)
full_model <- lm(AvgRating ~ GameWeight + LogPlaytime +
                   MinPlayers + MaxPlayers + LanguageEase + IsReimplementation +
                   NumWant + NumWish + NumOwned + NumUserRatings, 
                 data = games)

## Next Research Directions

**Proposed Investigations**

- Looking into a model with the log transformed variables that we decided in EDA.
  
- Checking interaction terms and dealing with correlation between predictors.

**Potential Exploration Areas**

- NumWish, NumWanted, NumOwned variable change

- Genre-specific rating factors
